# Temperature-regression
A regression analysis of temperature data to predict the next hour's temperature.

This is an ongoing project that begins with a very simple model and then progresses to greater and greater complexity.

- Our progress is seen by the improvement in the RMSE by changing the models labelled here as 1_, 2_, 3_, etc
- We focus on the random forest model:
    - We expect non-linear relationships in weather data which rf is particularly suited to handle unlike e.g. linear regression
    - The data set is large and training with rf is fast compared to SVN

Data taken from Kaggle weather dataset:
